# ZSL Amazing Animal Rescue 
# Design Documentation

## I. Introduction

In this game, the player(s) aim is to uncover facts and information that is hidden underneath a row of 'cards'. The player must move these cards and put them in order on a different row in order to reveal the hidden information. The game is being designed and made for ZSL and as such, the information included on and underneath the cards is to do with the greenhouse gas chain for 4 different products (Plastic bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef, and Electronics being left on standby) and the cards themselves are each step of the chain.

## II. Game Objective

The objective/purpose of this game is to teach children aged 11-16 about the steps that go in to making each of the 4 products, and raise awareness about how much greenhouse gas is produced. The game will also tell the player(s) how they can help to reduce the ammount of greenhouse gasses released.

## III. Genre

The game is a 2D, top down, educational puzzle solving game.

## VI. Features

- 2D Top Down
- Interactive
- Educational
- Web Based
- Tocuh Screen Support

## V. Platform

The game will be built as a web based app. This means that any device that has a compatable browser installed will be able to play the game. However, as requested by ZSL, the game will be optimised to run on iPad devices for use in their classes.

## Included Text

This section will detail what text is to be included in the game.

All the text shown here will be placed on the cards that the player has to drag and drop into the correct order. Each card will contain one step. The first and last steps of the chain will be already in place for the players to give them somewhere to begin.

# Project Management Documentation
##### Mark Biswell, Sam Pearce, Ryan Edwards & George Haughton

## I. Project Overview
We have been contracted by ZSL (Zoological Society of London) to design and produce an educational game based around the greenhouse gas chain for 4 different products, Plastic Bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef and Electronics that are left on stand-by. The game is to be used in classes the ZSL run at London Zoo for 11-16 year olds, the first of which will be run on the 14th November 2017. We will be having regular meetings with the client to collect feedback on our ideas and keep the client satisfied.

## Project Aims:
•	To create a fun and educational game

•	To educate students about climate change

•	To make it interactive for the kids to enjoy 

•	To raise awareness and how they can help stop climate change 

## Objectives:
•	Design documentation to be finshed by Monday 16th October 2017

•	Finish all of the proposal documentation by Monday 16th October 2017

•	To finish the development and building of the game by Sunday 29th October 2017

•	To make sure the game has been tested and is ready for shipping to the client by Monday 6th November 2017

## User and software Requirements:
•	Educational game

•	Interactive game

•	Multi-user 

•	Simplistic interface

•	Child friendly

•	Compatible with an IPad



### Cost: 
##### Overall, we had a few things that cost money in the project such as. 
* The First thing that 'cost' money is the systems that we used to create the application. The systems that we used at college are around £1500 including the screens and peripherals. This so far brings our cost to £6000 as there were 4 of us in a group. 
* Secondly the software that we used to create the game was called Unity Pro which cost around £130 per person. So, for the group of four would be around £520 just for the software to develop the game. We also used Adobe and Microsoft applications which are £40 a month for Adobe and £120 for Microsoft office. 
* Another cost was the internet. As we mostly used the internet at college we were unable to get the price of the internet.
* Another cost is the travel to and from ZSL Whipsnade Zoo for a minibus to take the class there for are final pitches.

### Scope: 
For this project we had to create a fun interactive game that is also education. As we had a very limited time to build this application we needed to make sure we had everything in order and made sure we meet the requirements and not focusing on things that was not needed. So to complete this project we knew that we had to focus on only the things inside the scope.

### Time:
We had 5 weeks in total to complete the project from when Michelle came in to pitch the idea to us. We then had just 2 weeks to complete all of the required design documentation to show Michelle when she can in to check on the progress. Within the first 2 weeks we also needed to complete a proposal to demonstrate and show the client our idea. The 3rd and 4th week were used for the development and construction of the application and the last week was used for testing and finalizing the application to then give the finished product to the client.

### Quality:
The Quality of the project was very important as this was for a serious client. It was going to be used in education lessons. So, the quality had to be top quality nothing less. Throughout the development process we worked to make sure that the application came across as professional and looked high quality.

### Communication: 
Throughout the ZSL project we stayed in touch with Michelle though Email as we sent back and forth ideas and questions on the application. as a group we also stayed in touch with text, in class and via email if we were sending work to one another. It was important that we stayed in commutation with each other out side of college so we could all stay on the same page while doing work. 

### Risk: 
The biggest risk that we had with taking on this project was the reputation for not only are selves but also reboot games as a company. It was our first client and we needed to make good and long-lasting impressions from the start so that they may want to work with us again in the future. We also want to make sure we were professional and have a good reputation for more clients down the road.

### Resources:
The Resources that we used during this project where: A Computer, Internet Access, Unity Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office 

## The Project Management Plan
The project management plan that we are using is called Scrum it is a basic framework that lots of people and groups use when doing work/project. The events within scrum are all aimed towards helping the project move forward some of events are Sprint, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review. All of these are work done within a certain time. The way scrum works within a project is it breaks the whole project down into Epics which are the main points of the project. Then the epics are set into User Stories which are smaller projects that once completed. Are combined to complete the epic which is then a min part of the project completed.

## II. First Client Meeting (2nd October 2017)
Our first meeting with the client involeed a representative from ZSL visiting us and giving a presentation about what they wanted us to create for them. The information given to us included:

## III. Schedule/Plan

## Work BreakDown Structure 
![image2015-4-24-11-12-10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927415/38812118-4a02b9dc-4183-11e8-8c86-0e0386603f32.png)

### What are epics and user stories:
### Epics:
An Epic is a larger user story. It can also be described as a big piece of work that has one common objective within the overall project. It could be a feature, customer request or business requirement. An Example is with ZSL they came to us and asked us to design and build an application which will help students on the affect we are having on the climate. We take that request and turn it into a couple of epics, for example "As a user I want to be able to learn about the affects I have on the climate" now from that epic we can then break that down further to give us User Stories.
### User stories:
A user story is something a user wants. However, think of these stories as going towards completing the overall epics. For example, when we discussed epics, we said how the client came to us and said "design and build an interactive application which will help educate students on the affect we are having on the climate". We took what they asked and turned it into an epic which was "As a user I want to be able to learn about the affects I have on the climate". From that epic we can break that down into User stories. As an example, we could create a user story which states "As a user I would like to see what affect im having".

* As a user I would like to be able to see which habitat I am in 
* As a user I would like to be able to select the habitat I want to enter
* As a user I would like to be able to see how I am helping the planet 
* As a user I would like to be able to use the app on a IPad 
* As a user I would like to be able to see the effects these habitats are under
* As a user i want to be able to navigate through the application easily
* As a user i would like there to be lots of colourful aspects of the application 
* As a user i would like to be able to go back to previous pages
* As a user i want to be able to read all of the information
* As a user i would like to stay engaged whilst using the app
* As a user i would like to be given cool facts as i use the app

## IV. Designing
### Concept Drawing:
|Explination:| Concept art:|
| -------------- | -------------- |
|The selection screen was a combined design as we all had the same idea for this screen, we wanted it to be simplistic as well as asphetically appealing. we wanted the player to be able to pick and choose from all 4 habitats and see a visual representation of each one.| ![selection screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996215-fbd55924-cd77-11e7-98f4-a6dcc7221d1f.PNG)|
|We originally wanted to have an animation once the player clicked on the habitat that they wanted to play. it was going to be a simple animation that would enlarge the graphic so you can see it clearer whilst loading the buttons which are added in the image below.|![animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996235-249363f6-cd78-11e7-8528-a12bcf8fc81e.PNG)|
|As you can see from the image to the right, we wanted the habitat that you selected to enlarge enough to see more detail but we also wanted the player to still be able to see the other habitats under it. We did not want the selected habitat to take over the whole screen.|![habitat screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996250-48c0be0e-cd78-11e7-9f4e-9c4c17edfc6b.PNG)|

## V. Concept Pitch (17th October 2017)
For our concept pitch, we traveled to ZSL Whipsnade to meet with the client. Before the meeting we had created a short powerpoint presentation with an idea of how we visioned the game as well as a few concept art designs to show where we wanted each element to go. Once the presentation was over we asked for feedback and questions to help us improve our idea and vision for the game. Below is a list of the feedback we recieved after the presentation.

Noted feedback:
* Maze screen - want the chain to be the main feature/focus.
* Show the whole cycle of each product.
* Increase the difficulty of each maze.
* Appeal to younger and older(different graphic options).
* More detailed graphics(Rainforest).
* Two different settings for different ages.
* Want to see the full affect of the greenhouse gases.
* Dont make the maze the full focus.
* Come back to the maze after each chain.

As you can see from the feedback above, there were a few things that we needed to do straight away and a few things that were suggested that were not so important. The client suggested that we make the main focus the chain instead of the maze idea, this was the main focus that we had after the meeting. the other comments about the graphics and the setting for two different age options was more of a suggestion if we had time, this allowed us to fully focus on the chain concept and if we had time, we could possibly impliment the option for two different age groups.

## VI. Adapting to Feedback
Below we will break down each point of feedback and explain how we adapted our designs and ideas for the game:
1. "Maze screen - want the chain to be the main feature/focus" - After the presentation, we sat down and decided that it was best to remove the maze as a whole and make the chain the sole focus. By doing this it would dramatically reduce our work load as well as appeal more to what the client wants.
2. "Show the whole cycle of each product." - Like in the above point, we were able to reach this outcome by making the chain the main focus of the game, this then allowed us to include the full chain which is what the client wanted.
3. "Increase the difficulty of each maze." - Like the above two points, we completely removed the maze feature from the game which means this point no longer applies to the game.
4. "Appeal to younger and older(different graphic options)." - We decided to leave this point to be one of the last things to work on as the client said they would like the option for this however it was not mandatory to do so.
5. "More detailed graphics(Rainforest)." - After the presentation we worked to changing the rainforest graphic to make it look more realistic and belivable. This was a very straightfoward task and did not require each member to work on so it was done quickly by one member whilst the others worked on implimenting other features.
6. "Two different settings for different ages." - This feedback is basically the fourth point where the client suggested that we make a option to change the graphics depending on the age of the players. we put this at the bottom of our priorities because like mentioned above, it was only a suggestion not a mandatory feature.
7. "Want to see the full affect of the greenhouse gases." - We planned to have the graphic elements of the game change as they completed the chain. This would have provided a visual representation of how the affects of each stage change our planet which would hopefully trigger a realisation for the player.
8. "Dont make the maze the full focus." - Like in the first point, we completly removed the maze so that we could make the chain the main focus, this would in turn get the message to the player quicker and more efficently.
9. "Come back to the maze after each chain." - We had the idea to possibly incorperate the maze back in the game if we had time however we did not get around to doing so as we felt the chain provided the correct amount of play time for each habitat.


### Visual adaptions:
| Habitat selction screen:               | Before Feedback:        | After Feedback:           |
| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| As you can see from the images to the right, the only real change was the top right graphic as the client felt that it was not a true representation of how the real habitat looks like.| ![zsl-habitat-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32994252-61a2f278-cd5c-11e7-8b80-32b72ada6740.png)| ![zsl-menu-final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33014287-beb31e0c-cdde-11e7-985c-0ba86f1f630b.png)|

| Rainforest graphic:               | Before Feedback:        | After Feedback:           |
| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| Like above, the rainforest graphic was the main change of the visual elements, the client said that it was too unrealistic as it did not look dense enough. To improve the overall look of this graphic we increased the density by downloading a few free brushes which allowed us to get a better looking design.| ![zsl-jungle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33013646-a70ff466-cddc-11e7-90c0-39b75b71b5a6.png)| ![zsl-jungle-recovered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33013662-c0e8f7fc-cddc-11e7-8954-cce5c5a0d505.jpg)|

| Game Screen:               | Before Feedback:        | After Feedback:           |
| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| With the original concept art we felt that it looked a little too cartoony. With the major change being the removal of the maze we decided to make the elements appeal to the client more, in order to do so we needed to add a lot more information on the screena about the chain.| ![zsl-game-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33013769-13a112ea-cddd-11e7-9a8e-c43e99f727f8.png)| ![zsl-ocean-game-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33014075-eacb21f2-cddd-11e7-9020-0d18243f677f.png)|

The problems we had with are game screens where that firstly she wasnt happy with the rainforest image as she thought I just looked like a bunch of trees it didn’t have much depth like a rainforest should have we adapted to this by going back to photoshop and editing the image to look more like a rainforest once we had done this we sent it over to her via email and she confermed it looked a lot better and the customer was now happy with the image. Also, when it came to the educational side of the game she thought as though we was focusing too hard on the engaging side with game part of the app was going to take too much time away from the learning experience so we decided to get rid of maze idea completely and went with a basic fill In the gaps game for the user which she enjoyed a lot more. When we were presenting the game the first time we got a lot of verbal feedback about the game as well as some points on what she thinks could be improved. Which helped and when we did the final presentation they got to test the game out to see if they could break it or find any bugs. This was good as we had many people testing the game. They could not find any bugs or glitches with the game they just pointed out ways that again maybe the game could be improved  

## VI. Research
The different research methods that we used though out the ZSL project starting from the first pitch was taking notes about what she wanted in the program and what the uses of it would be. We went away as a group to brain storm different ideas on how we would fill all of the requests on are app. We did some research on ZSL and what it is doing to help the environment, we also looked at other ways the world is trying to help stop climate change. When Michelle came in to check up on are apps we took more notes on the information that she gave us as feedback from the feedback we realised that we had gone off track a little and her new feedback had pushed us back on track.

## VII. Tools and Techniques
### Tools -
#### Photoshop - 
We used Photoshop to create are 4 habitat backgrounds. Which saved us money instead of buying them from a web source which can be expensive. We also used Photoshop to create the maze in are first prototype of our game. Photoshop was also used to create the greenhouse gas meter on the right hand side
#### Github - 
As a group we used GitHub a lot to trade documentation between all of us as when we were not in class it was harder to send work to each other and we also used it to keep a backup every one uploaded work there and when a certain person needed something they knew where to go. We also used it to make a glossary for the finished ZSL project where we had all are finished documentation
#### Unity - 
We used Unity to create are application. We figured unity was the best to use as a group of 4 we could all work on it at the same time and then upload it for each other so we could complete it faster. It was also easy to use and had a lot of assists which we used as we were only starting out on the program. 
#### Power Point - 
We used Power Point for are presentations, first when she came in to see are ideas and concept designs we made a short presentation to show off the ideas so it was easy for her to see what are ideas where. We also used Power Point to present are final game to them when we went to Whipsnade zoo. We showed are finished design and how we adapted to feed back. The reason we used Power Point was that it is the simplest and best presentation software out there. We also used Power Point online so all four of us could work on different slides for the certain parts of work that each person did.

### Techniques -
#### Interviews - 
We had multiple interviews with ZSL. The first one was when Michelle came in to tell us about the project and what she wants at the end of it. We all took notes so that we could get more information from what she was saying as well as off the Power Point she had. The other Interview we did was when we were at ZSL presenting are final game.
#### Prototyping -
We used prototyping when was creating are game in Unity we tested everything after doing sections of code and saving backups all the time. We also loaded up separate Unity programs to test certain parts to see if each part was working so if we had a problem when we put it together it would be easier to find the problem  
#### Presentations -
We presented are game in a presentation as it is easy to get your points across and it captures people’s attention when you are standing at the front of the room and have your presentation behind you. You can also use your body language and speaking skills to help present your work and get it across 

## VIII. Review / Evaluation

#### Imoportance Of Team Dynamics In The Success and/or Failure Of Group Work
Team Dynamics is important in the success or failure of group work because you are able to share the work load and this can be a good thing or a bad thing if you share the work out and it all gets done then you will finish on time and with a quality piece of work. But on the other hand, if you share out the work load and work is not done by someone in the group then the work will not be complete and you finish with an uncompleted piece of work and will fail whatever you set out to do. An example of this is in are ZSL project where at the start we set out all of the user stories and gave them certain people in our group. This worked very well for us as we all understood are roles and knew what work we needed to complete so we completed on time and produced a good application.
The success and failure of the project is not the only major factor to think about when it comes to team dynamics. The reputation of the company is also at stake when undertaking a project for an external client. The Initial idea that we came up with for the client did not meet their expectation as we had side tracked too much. The main feature that they wanted was not included in our prototype a therefore we needed to scrap our prototype idea and change our design completely. If we were in a competitive environment, then the client more than likely would have backed out completely to go with a company that could produce exactly what they wanted. I feel as though the main reason for not meeting the client’s full expectation was down to a lack of confidence and communication as we simply did not work together in the beginning to come up with an appropriate concept. This whole mistake highlights the importance of team dynamics as if we had correctly worked together and communicated affectively then we would have been able to produce a concept which to the client would be acceptable

The first half of the development for ZSL shows how a lack of team dynamics can slow down the production of a team’s abilities. Not only does team dynamics allow individuals to manage the work load so that a higher rate of production is accomplished. When you know you have done good work and that others are happy with what you have done then it gives you a sense of accomplishment to which that will massively help the team dynamics.


#### Tools And Techniques 
The reason we chose to use are selected tools and techniques was because we had experience using them and they all had the benefit of more than one person working it at a time which helped with are time management and we’ll all had backups which was good security for the project. All of the tools and Techniques where perfect for each part of the project we used them for we had no trouble with any of them. Overall we took are time to make sure we chose the right tools and techniques so we didn’t run into any problems with the project down the round. This benefited us a lot as we didn’t run into any problems with them 

#### Project Management Process / Research
Firstly, the project management process helped us meet the objectives and helped us with are learning because it made us follow a schedule that we created and confirmed that we could work to it so there were no excuses for the work to not be done. So this helped us with are time management and also working outside of college time. The management also helped us know what we had to do that day or what we had to do once we finished a certain part of the work. This helped with are performance because if we fell behind the project would not get done. 

Secondly the research that we did about ZSL, The Zoo’s and mostly Climate Change so that when we were putting game together all of the facts and questions was correct. The researched also helped us with knowing what to put in are game for example if we had the rainforest back ground we would need to know what animals to put in this area otherwise it will be wrong and we will look non-professional with mistakes like that. Also the researched helped us with the greenhouse gas chain as we had to research it and get to know why it’s bad and what it is doing to the earth. 

### The Project Overall
Overall I believe that the project for ZSL went very well. We stayed on schedule and completed at the right time which I was happy about knowing we done all that work in such a short space of time, knowing all the work we did was now set out in front of us done. The decision making throughout the project with the team was good we agreed on most things but then if we didn’t on one thing then we had a debate on what we were disagreeing on. I learnt from these debates that it is a good way to sort out problems and also to spark up new ideas with the group. 

I think that if we had more time than we would have produced a totally different more engaging game for ZSL but seeing as we was stuck to such a short time we wanted to produce something that met the guide lines and had a little entertainment on it. If we had more time the game would not only be more engaging for the users but also a lot more educational. We could have added bonus questions if they finish early or a leader board for the kids to compete. But overall again the project went well and the client was happy that is main thing when working for a client    

The team was the biggest thing that made this project happen. This was not a solo project there was four of us that worked hard on this project and the team dynamics is really what helped us complete this project. We stayed in communication every time that we did work outside of class. Also, when we did work in class we check each other’s work to make sure each other was meeting the requirements and still on track. We worked very well as a team we split the work up equally and didn’t make one person do everything with one person working on each habitat the work flowed very well  

### My Role
My role in the group for the ZSL project was at the start when she came in to do the first pitch I was taking all of the notes about what she wanted on the game and when it should be done by. Once the design and development got under way I was nominated to search around the internet for ideas for the concept art and also to set up all the GitHub collaborations and unity collaborations. When she came in to do the second pitch and to see are demos I was back on note duty making sure I got all the changes she wanted written down. When it came to the final presentation I gave out the iPads with are game loaded up to the judges then took notes. Overall, I believe that I did all of my tasks well as we meet all of the changes she wanted and also we ended up with really good art. 

## IX. Styles and Formats
When we were presenting are ZSL project in are final presentation we used many different styles and formats to get are final application across in the best way that we could. Trying to make it as engaging as possible and as interesting as possible. Firstly, in the pitch we knew that we would need to act like professionals as we were being given an amazing opportunity. So, I knew that my body language was going to have to be positive, engaging and mature also the text within the game and PowerPoint would have to be not to formal but there could not be any slang in the text otherwise it could be a bad influence on the users.

Other things that we had to consider was Concept art to show the development of the program. Also when she came for the first check-up we had a demo to show her which was good because she could see what the game was going to look like and act like
